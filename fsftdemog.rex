   This is a simple homegrown utility program that determines the storage
   drives that are available on the system. Once we have a list of all the 
   storage devices, we will obtain the contents of the file system on each
   device and do a simple demographic analysis of the file types that are
   found.

   See if we were passed an argument.  If so, see if it is equal to the
   word debug. If it is, set a logic flag that we will use to control the
   messages we will write to our log file.   

   Next identify the input file that contains the list of the base
   directories/folders that we want to make backups from. Create a unique
   file name that we can use for our log file that will track the programs
   execution.
